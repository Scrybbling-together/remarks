# Rotations

Each of the following files in this folder is rotated 0, 90, 180 or 270 degrees respective to their names.

All of them have the text "hello" written in parallel to the underline of the "PDF with some text" heading.

The pages should appear rotated, with the text "hello" appropriately rotated with the rest of the document such that there is only one correct reading orientation for the document.

There are currently no automated tests for these documents, they need to be inspected visually.
